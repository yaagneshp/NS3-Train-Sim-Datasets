# FRAMEWORK TO UNDERSTAND AND IMPROVE PERFORMANCE OF 5G USER EQUIPMENT IN METRO TRAINS DATASET

This repository contains datasets generated from NS-3 simulations of 5G user equipment (UE) behavior in metro train environments.  
The data can be used for research and analysis of 5G performance in challenging scenarios such as high-speed mobility, tunnels, and handover events.
